* should turn this whole repository purely into one for "selfH" (give
  it another name).

* use various .c and _prototypes.h files for testing purposes in a
  test directory.

* improve the regular expression (doesn't even accept procedure
  variable arguments currently); but, really use an existing parser;
  but, for that, move to OCaml or C.
